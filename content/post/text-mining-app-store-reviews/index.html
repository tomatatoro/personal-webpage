<p><strong>Q:</strong> We published our app on the App Store, and the reviews are flooding in! It’s easy enough to read one or two reviews, but I just don’t have the time to go through hundreds. How can we summarize these reviews and take advantage of this data?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Luckily, there are plenty of machine learning techniques to tackle unstructured data like text. We can leverage exploratory data analysis (“EDA”), as well as text mining techniques like sentiment analysis and keyword extraction to (1) visualize patterns in the data, (2) understand public opinion of the product/service, and (3) identify common complaints.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll demonstrate how we can use R to download, analyze, and visualize key patterns in Apple App Store reviews. As a lover of webtoons, I’m a big fan of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tapas-comics-and-novels/id578836126">Tapas</a>, so I’ll be analyzing the reviews for their app!</p>
<div id="setup-and-getting-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup and Getting Data</h2>
<p>To start, we’ll use the <strong>appler</strong> package to download the latest user reviews for Tapas. (<em>disclaimer: the App Store API only allows users to download the latest 500 reviews. If you have thousands of reviews, you can still apply the same analyses!</em>)</p>
<pre class="r"><code># App store ID can be found in the app store URL: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tapas-comics-and-novels/id578836126
reviews &lt;- appler::get_apple_reviews(578836126, country = &#39;us&#39;, all_results = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Great! Now we can use the dim() and head() functions to look at how large the dataset is, and what it looks like.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dim(reviews)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 500   7</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>head(reviews, 3)</code></pre>

This is honestly just infuriating, because so many artists are being forced to go over their old comics and edit them to cover up scenes that were even slightly sexual, which takes away from time they could be using to make legitimate updates. It’s really really dumb.

## 3 Honestly I like everything about tapas but it’s too expensive if u only read manga on the app like me then the best deal you can get is $1=4 chapters. Yeah you can earn the ink but there’s multiple problems with that, if you try to earn it through apps then it doesn’t work at all, the poles work but take a lot of time for very little reward and the ads ur only allowed a certain amount every so often. The price just makes people wanna go to pirating cites instead, I think if the prices were lowered then more people would be willing to actually pay for the content instead of stealing it online.</code></pre>
<p>The dataset has 500 rows, with 7 variables. The variables we’ll be working with most are review_time, app_version, rating, and review.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-data-analysis-what-patterns-are-in-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis: What patterns are in the data?</h2>
<p>Before diving into any analysis, let’s do some EDA get a sense of what we’re working with. The graph below plots the distribution of reviews over time.
<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, the majority of reviews are from early 2021, and it seems like fewer and fewer people reviewed the Tapas app in recent months. Is this indicative of fewer users in recent months? What if we looked at the app’s average rating over time?</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The Tapas app’s average rating was steadily growing up until July 2021, at which point the rating dips. By September, the average rating was essentially back where it started. So what happened in July-September 2021 that caused the rating to fall?</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>If we plot version rollouts over time, we see that version 5.10 (the dark blue area) was the most prevalent version in September 2021, when ratings dipped. Sure enough, when we plot average ratings by app version, we can see that version 5.10 had the lowest rating since version 5.5.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>So with EDA, we discovered that <strong>ratings were growing steadily until version 5.9, and then the Tapas app experienced a dramatic dip with version 5.10.</strong> Now that we know the <em>what</em>, we can think about the <em>why</em>: stakeholders at Tapas would want to know <em>why</em> the dip happened, so they can avoid a similar situation in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="text-mining" class="section level2">
<h2>Text Mining</h2>
<p>So far we’ve only been looking at ratings, but there’s a whole gold-mine of information we’ve yet to touch: the reviews! There are hundreds of ways you can analyze text data. I’ll focus on two popular approaches: <strong>sentiment analysis</strong> and <strong>keyword extraction</strong>.</p>
<div id="sentiment-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
<p>Sentiment analysis is exactly what it sounds like: taking a body of text and determining whether the underlying sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis can offer another helpful metric to help businesses understand public opinion of their product or service.</p>
<p>Before we can run our sentiment analysis, we need to clean the reviews. This often involves stripping punctuation, removing uninformative stop words (e.g., “the”, “a”, “and”), as well as other cleaning steps. Eventually, our “cleaned” reviews will look like this:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="63%" />
<col width="36%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Raw</th>
<th align="left">Cleaned</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">The app itself is garbage. It was working just fine and now it freezes or crashes constantly, forcing you to reboot it. This does not make for a pleasant reading experience.</td>
<td align="left">app garbage work just fine now freeze crash constantly force reboot make pleasant read experience</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, using the “syuzhet” package in R, we can calculate a sentiment score for each cleaned review. To illustrate how this works, consider the example review above. The “get_sentiment()” function will assign a score for each word in the cleaned review.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>example_words &lt;- example %&gt;% 
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = review_cleaned, token = &#39;words&#39;) %&gt;% 
  select(word)

example_sentiment &lt;- example_words %&gt;% mutate(sentiment_score = syuzhet::get_sentiment(word))

example_sentiment</code></pre>
<pre><code>##          word sentiment_score
## 1         app            0.00
## 2     garbage           -0.50
## 3        work            0.25
## 4        just            0.00
## 5        fine            0.25
## 6         now            0.00
## 7      freeze           -0.40
## 8       crash           -0.75
## 9  constantly            0.00
## 10      force           -0.60
## 11     reboot            0.00
## 12       make            0.00
## 13   pleasant            1.00
## 14       read            0.00
## 15 experience            0.00</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, a negative word like “garbage” has a negative score of -0.5, while a more positive word like “fine” will have a positive score of 0.25. The more negative or positive the word, the higher the magnitude of the score. So a word like “crash” is considered more negative than a word like “garbage.” The final score of the review is the total score across all words. In this case, the total score would be -0.75, indicating an overall negative sentiment. <em>These scores are pulled from “lexicons” assembled by literary researchers. I’m using Syuzhet, <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/syuzhet/versions/1.0.6">the default lexicon in the syuzhet package that was developed in the Nebraska Literary Lab</a>.</em>)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reviews &lt;- reviews %&gt;% 
  mutate(sentiment_score = syuzhet::get_sentiment(review_cleaned, method = &#39;syuzhet&#39;),
         sentiment_direction = case_when(
           sign(sentiment_score) &gt; 0 ~ &#39;positive&#39;,
           sign(sentiment_score) == 0 ~ &#39;neutral&#39;,
           sign(sentiment_score) &lt; 0 ~ &#39;negative&#39;
           )
         )</code></pre>

<p>#Reviews with positive sentiment. Sentiment is good at picking up negative reviews, but gets confused with positive reviews, especially if it has mixed language.</p>

If you’re a comic book fan and you feel the need to support these artists who have worked so hard to make these stories a reality then by all means go for it. Just let yourself go broke reading one book.

|I love this app! I spend a majority of my time reading this. It brings a smile to me and makes my day better and more entertaining. The only thing though is as of late, when I try to select a comic to read, the app freezes and I have to constantly open and close it to try to read. When I do SUCEED I maybe get two scrolls before it freezes again and then blacks out and shuts itself down. Sometimes when I’m in the middle of reading one, it will close out as well. The app might need an update for bugs. There are times I’m not even able to read on it at all because it takes so long for it to try to work. |love app spend majority time read bring smile make day good much entertain thing though late try select comic read app freeze constantly open close try read suceed maybe get two scroll freeze black shut sometimes middle read one will close good app may need update bug time even able read take long try work |

|Overall an amazing app to read webtoons through legit way but recently it has been crashing a lot. It has happen multiple time with no true improvement. Like I haven’t been able to open the app for last 4 days. It if the servers been down for 5 days I feel like this is something you need to inform your readers. (Updated)if you delete the app and redownload the app it works perfectly fine. |overall amaze app read webtoons legit way recently crash lot happen multiple time true improvement like haven t able open app last day server day feel like something need inform reader update delete app redownload app work perfectly fine |</p>
