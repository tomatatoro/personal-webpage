<p>Welcome! My name is Tato. I’m a coder, designer, and data enthusiast, and I’m passionate about telling stories. I have over three years of experience working in <a href="https://www.analysisgroup.com/">economic consulting</a>, where I solve complex, analytical problems at the intersection of business, economics, and law. I hold a dual-degree in Statistics and Economics from UC Berkeley and an MBA from NYU Stern.</p>
<p>Do you have a data story you want to tell? Let’s talk! You can reach me via email or LinkedIn.</p>
