<p>Hi, my name is Tato and I currently work as an economic consultant at Analysis Group. I hold a <strong>dual-degree in Statistics and Economics</strong> from UC Berkeley and an <strong>MBA</strong> from NYU Stern.</p>
<p>One of the favorite parts of my job is getting my hands dirty with data. I think of data as a sandbox. At face value, it’s just box full of sand, and every datapoint is one grain among millions. But in the same way we use shovels and molds to build elaborate castles, we can use tools to add structure to data and extract important insights.</p>
<p>After working in consulting for <strong>four years,</strong> I’ve worked with a lot of different companies, with a lot of different data, that ask a lot of different questions. As a result, I’ve gotten quite good at using the necessary tools to translate that data into answers. So if you’re ready to jump in the sandbox, let’s connect! You can reach me via email or LinkedIn.</p>
